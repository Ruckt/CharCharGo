# CharCharGo

Pinging Duck Duck Go for a display of TV characters.

A sample project that displays the use of one code base with two targets (two different REST API calls). Using the search engine Duck Duck Go, the app either pings a lits of Seinfeld or Simpsons characters and displays in either a grid or list view.

The grid view is the default layout only displaying images (should one exist, otherwise a placeholder).  The list view only displays the name of the show's character.

A navigation bar button switches the layout view between list and grid.

Selecting an item in either layout loads a detail view with the image, title, and description of the character.

On a tablet, the list & detail view show on the same screen in landscape format.  On phone, the detail view is of full screen.
